			<p class="V2">(b) excise duty is chargeable on the wine or made-wine as a result of section 54 or 55,</p>
			<p class="V2">(c) after the excise duty point in relation to that charge, a person mixes or otherwise adds, at any place in the United Kingdom, water or any other substance to the wine or made-wine in a case where what results (“the new product”) is intended for sale, and</p>
			<p class="V2">(d) if the addition had taken place immediately before that duty point, the amount of the excise duty would have been greater than the amount actually payable.</p>
			<p class="V2">(2) The addition attracts a penalty under section 9 of the Finance Act 1994 (civil penalties), and the new product is liable to forfeiture.</p>
