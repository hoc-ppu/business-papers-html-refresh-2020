<MotionText>That this House pays tribute to the commitment and dedication of the 1,700 civilian seafarers, including trainees, at the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA); is concerned that nearly fifteen years of pay restraint is having a negative effect on recruitment, retention, training and industrial relations in the RFA; notes that inflation and pay restraint have effectively cut the value of RFA seafarers' pay by over thirty per cent since 2009-10; further notes that the number of RFA seafarers has fallen by twenty eight per cent since 2015 which compromises full and safe deployment of the RFA fleet; notes that RFA's thirteen ships support, re-supply and re-fuel the Royal Navy fleet on international deployment, combat drug trafficking and discharge the UK's humanitarian responsibilities following natural disasters; recognises the integral role that RFA crew play in maintaining the security and international interests of the UK and its maritime allies; highlights the RMT union's finding that nearly sixty per cent of RFA seafarers have worked for the RFA for over ten years; and calls on the Government to convene a forum with the recognised trade unions in the RFA to agree a fair pay award and wider reforms to prevent a crewing crisis at the RFA.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House demands the immediate release of Filipino community journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, who has been in detention since her arrest along with four human rights defenders since 7 February 2020 in Tacloban City; believes that the evidential basis for her arrest was fabricated, and that she is innocent of the charges; considers that the treatment of Cumpio is an attempt to silence messengers of truth and a clear violation of press freedom; fears that this represents a direct assault against Eastern Vista, which Cumpio heads as executive director, for its role in highlighting the issues of the marginalised and oppressed sectors in Eastern Visayas region, particularly the continuing plight of Yolanda victims, and the militarisation of farmers&#8217; communities, among others; regards this case as yet another indication of the shrinking democratic space in the Philippines, as the administration hopes to deprive the poorest of the poor of another platform by which their voices are heard; and therefore supports the National Union of Journalists and International Federation of Journalists in calling on the UK Government to use every diplomatic effort to secure Cumpio&#8217;s release.</MotionText>
