<MotionText>That this House regrets that the UK has received its lowest-ever rank on the ILGA-Europe&#8217;s Rainbow Map; recognises the 2024 Rainbow Map is the organisation's 13th&#160;annual review of the human rights situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people in&#160;49&#160; countries in&#160;Europe and Central Asia; further regrets the UK&#8217;s 51% rating, noting the decline from last year&#8217;s rating of 53.9%; acknowledges this ranking is a result of the UK Government's decision to block the Scottish Parliament's Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill, delays to the banning of conversion practices and the UK Government&#8217;s treatment of LGBTI migrants, including fears that the Illegal Migration Act may be used to expel LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to their home or a third country; condemns this government&#8217;s record of failing to protect and support LGBTQ+ communities; and calls for an urgent reflection on the direction this Government is taking on human rights.</MotionText>
