<MotionText>That this House notes that people with terminal illnesses cannot currently access their State Pension until their retirement age; recognises that this is the case even for individuals who have made full National Insurance contributions; acknowledges that poverty rates are disproportionately high amongst the terminally ill; commends research by Loughborough University showing that granting State Pensions to this group would almost halve the rate of poverty within this cohort while costing only &#163;144 million per year, just 0.1% of the annual State Pension bill; and calls on the Government to allow early access to State Pensions for people diagnosed with a terminal illness.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House expresses its deep concern regarding the Gambian National Assembly&#8217;s consideration of a Bill which would repeal that country&#8217;s ban on female genital mutilation (FGM); offers its unqualified condemnation of the practice of FGM; considers FGM to be a violation of the human rights of girls and women, including the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to physical integrity, and the rights of the child; notes the World Health Organization evaluation of the practice as one which has no health benefits and can lead to excessive bleeding, urinary problems, shock, psychological problems and even death; recognises that the United Nations Population Fund estimates that over four million girls are at risk of FGM each year; believes that no justification for the practice can be found from the religion of either Islam or Christianity; understands that FGM has been outlawed in The Gambia since 2015 with the imposition of fines and prison sentences of up to three years for individuals who engage in the practice, and life imprisonment in instances where the practice led to death; further understands that the bill has been referred to a parliamentary committee for further consideration before moving to a final vote of all members of the Gambian National Assembly; and urges lawmakers in The Gambia to retain the ban on FGM and uphold the human rights of Gambian women.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House is concerned that the latest Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 556, which will prevent overseas care workers from bringing their dependants to the UK and makes substantial changes to the Ukraine schemes, will have a negative impact on migrant families; notes in particular that the changes will likely force carers into acquiescing to exploitative conditions at work or plunge them into destitution; recognises the importance of family members to carers often carrying out low-paid but crucial work in the UK&#8217;s social care sector; further notes with concern the lack of opportunity for the abrupt changes to the Ukraine schemes to have been scrutinised properly within the usual 21-day period before implementation; further recognises the stress and harm that the changes will cause by separating Ukrainian families, particularly where one or more family members are left behind in Ukraine; also notes the harm that will be caused by no longer permitting Ukrainian nationals to sponsor family members under the Homes for Ukraine scheme; and calls on the Home Office to properly tackle migrant worker exploitation and urgently reconsider its changes to the Ukraine schemes.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House pays tribute to the commitment and dedication of the 1,700 civilian seafarers, including trainees, at the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA); is concerned that nearly fifteen years of pay restraint is having a negative effect on recruitment, retention, training and industrial relations in the RFA; notes that inflation and pay restraint have effectively cut the value of RFA seafarers' pay by over thirty per cent since 2009-10; further notes that the number of RFA seafarers has fallen by twenty eight per cent since 2015 which compromises full and safe deployment of the RFA fleet; notes that RFA's thirteen ships support, re-supply and re-fuel the Royal Navy fleet on international deployment, combat drug trafficking and discharge the UK's humanitarian responsibilities following natural disasters; recognises the integral role that RFA crew play in maintaining the security and international interests of the UK and its maritime allies; highlights the RMT union's finding that nearly sixty per cent of RFA seafarers have worked for the RFA for over ten years; and calls on the Government to convene a forum with the recognised trade unions in the RFA to agree a fair pay award and wider reforms to prevent a crewing crisis at the RFA.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House notes that Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) is an autonomic nervous system abnormality where sitting, standing and exercise can cause symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain, brain fog, dizziness, pain, fainting, vomiting and fatigue; recognises that many people suffer a combination of symptoms, which can be chronic and debilitating, in some cases, leaving people bed ridden; further notes that while there is currently no cure for PoTS, studies indicate that 90% of people with a diagnosis of PoTS have improved or managed symptoms due to medically guided treatments and lifestyle changes but awareness of the condition is still low which may explain why the average time from first presentation of symptoms to diagnosis is seven years; and recognises the need to both raise awareness of the condition amongst medical professionals, and increase the support offered to those who suffer from PoTS.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House expresses support and solidarity with the 1,200 Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) union members working for the Office of National Statistics (ONS) in Newport, Titchfield, London, Darlington, Manchester and Edinburgh who are currently balloting for industrial action over mandatory attendance at workplaces; notes that there was no previous requirement to spend a specific amount of time in offices but, in late 2023, workers were told that from January 2024 they would need to spend a minimum of 20% of their working time in the workplace, increasing to 40% from April; agrees with the PCS that the post-pandemic arrangements at the ONS have been an example of best practice in flexible and sustainable ways of working and that no evidence-based business case has been made for disrupting this model; further notes that this sudden change has caused anger among staff, already demoralised by the lack of trust and the need for rapid changes to their childcare and other arrangements; and calls on the Government to engage in meaningful talks with the union to arrive at a sensible way forward that accommodates the legitimate concerns of ONS employees.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House welcomes the findings of the UK Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) which vindicates women born in the 1950s who were severely impacted when their state pension age was raised with little or no notice; notes that the Ombudsman's conclusions that the Government needs to act swiftly to ensure a compensation scheme is established to remedy the failings by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP); further notes with concern that the Ombudsman&#8217;s report highlights that the DWP has clearly indicated that it will refuse to comply; believes that this is completely unacceptable and agrees that DWP must do the right thing and be held accountable for its failure to do so; is mindful of the suffering of the woman affected by the changes to their state pension age, with retirement plans thrown into chaos, leaving many in dire financial straits, exacerbated during a cost of living crisis; appreciates that the generation of women affected have already been victims of pay discrimination; commends the Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) campaigners who have conducted their campaign for pension justice with dignity despite provocation in the form of dismissal and intransigence from the Government over many years; urges the Government to accept the fact that the women affected need and deserve compensation which recognises their financial loss and distress; and rejects any attempts to erect barriers which will prevent prompt access to compensation so that all WASPI women can finally enjoy the retirement they have earned.</MotionText>
