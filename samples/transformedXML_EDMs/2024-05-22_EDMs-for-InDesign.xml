<MotionText>That this House supports calls to implement an essentials guarantee into Universal Credit to ensure no one goes without life&#8217;s essentials; commends the Trussell Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on their Essentials Guarantee campaign; congratulates these organisations on securing more than 150,000 petition signatures in support of the campaign; recognises an essentials guarantee would create a standard allowance for Universal Credit which always covers the cost of essentials including food, fuel, essential travel, communications, and sundries; regrets the existing Universal Credit standard allowance is exacerbating experiences of poverty; believes that while everyone&#8217;s needs are different, an essentials guarantee would provide baseline support to the benefit of all claimants; acknowledges that an essentials guarantee would guarantee a baseline income which, at a minimum, guarantees affordability for the cost of essentials; notes that relative needs would be further supported on top of the standard allowance for Universal Credit; recognises that benefit levels in the UK are insufficient in supporting families; further commends the efforts of the Scottish Government in exploring the possibility of a minimum income guarantee for all; and further calls on the Government to reform the UK welfare system to adequately support those who are unemployed or in low paid work.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House notes the melancholy anniversary of the terrorist attack at Manchester Arena during the Ariana Grande concert which killed twenty-two and injured many others on this day seven years ago; whilst noting the long public inquiry and its many conclusions, believes that there are many questions still unanswered, foremost amongst which are the reasons why the adherents of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group were allowed, indeed encouraged, to coalesce in the City of Manchester and kept in a semi-detached relationship by successive British governments as intelligence assets waiting to be used, as they subsequently were, to assist the overthrow of the then  Libyan government; and further believes that this Frankenstein monster came back to slaughter the innocents in the Manchester Arena and no politician has been held to account for what turned out to be a disastrous policy all round.</MotionText>
