<MotionText>That this House notes the huge cost of private rents in England and increase in private rents since private tenancies were deregulated and section 21 no-fault evictions were introduced under the Housing Act 1988; recognises the challenges with accurately estimating average private rents but further notes historical data points to an average &#163;410 per month rent across all private sector tenancies in 1990, in 2023 prices, and ONS data indicating the average private rent in England in February 2024 was &#163;1,276 per month, suggesting roughly a threefold increase; is deeply concerned by the homelessness crisis and the 50% rise of homelessness in one year due to no-fault evictions and that English councils spent &#163;1.7bn on temporary accommodation last year; further notes that the cost of private rented accommodation in England is higher and renters' rights weaker than in European countries with rent controls and more secure tenancies; calls on the Government to establish an independent Living Rent Commission tasked with consulting on and designing a national system of rent controls with local flexibility and to provide powers to local councils to control rents in high rent areas; believes rent controls must be implemented gradually and fairly alongside a suite of policies to give renters security of tenure and to address the housing supply crisis, including a mass programme of zero-carbon social homes; and further calls on the Government to follow the example of Scotland and other European countries by legislating for rent controls in the private rented sector.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House is concerned that the latest Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 556, which will prevent overseas care workers from bringing their dependants to the UK and makes substantial changes to the Ukraine schemes, will have a negative impact on migrant families; notes in particular that the changes will likely force carers into acquiescing to exploitative conditions at work or plunge them into destitution; recognises the importance of family members to carers often carrying out low-paid but crucial work in the UK&#8217;s social care sector; further notes with concern the lack of opportunity for the abrupt changes to the Ukraine schemes to have been scrutinised properly within the usual 21-day period before implementation; further recognises the stress and harm that the changes will cause by separating Ukrainian families, particularly where one or more family members are left behind in Ukraine; also notes the harm that will be caused by no longer permitting Ukrainian nationals to sponsor family members under the Homes for Ukraine scheme; and calls on the Home Office to properly tackle migrant worker exploitation and urgently reconsider its changes to the Ukraine schemes.</MotionText>
