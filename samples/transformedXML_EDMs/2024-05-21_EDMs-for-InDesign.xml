<MotionText>That this House notes the melancholy anniversary of the terrorist attack at Manchester Arena during the Ariana Grande concert which killed twenty-two and injured many others on this day seven years ago; whilst noting the long public inquiry and its many conclusions, believes that there are many questions still unanswered, foremost amongst which are the reasons why the adherents of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group were allowed, indeed encouraged, to coalesce in the City of Manchester and kept in a semi-detached relationship by successive British governments as intelligence assets waiting to be used, as they subsequently were, to assist the overthrow of the then  Libyan government; and further believes that this Frankenstein monster came back to slaughter the innocents in the Manchester Arena and no politician has been held to account for what turned out to be a disastrous policy all round.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House is alarmed by reports that Imperial War Museums plans to derecognise the Public and Commercial Services union and the First Division Association for the purposes of collective representation and bargaining; is concerned that derecognising these trade unions would undermine the collective bargaining power of staff, leaving them vulnerable to arbitrary decisions by management, with limited recourse for addressing grievances or negotiating fair terms of employment; warns that derecognising any union undermines the principles of democracy and representation in the workplace, and could have significant negative effects on equality by exacerbating wage disparities, reducing job security and access to benefits, worsening working conditions, diminishing workers&#8217; voice and representation, limiting training and advancement opportunities, and weakening legal protections for workers; and calls on the Government to intervene to help resolve this dispute by ensuring that these unions remain recognised by Imperial War Museums.</MotionText>
