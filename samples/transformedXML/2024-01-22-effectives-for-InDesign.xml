<MotionText><from_cdata>That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill because, whilst it provides for changes to the North Sea oil and gas licensing regime, the North Sea Transition Authority is clear that legislation to mandate annual licensing rounds is not needed, the Bill will not deliver energy security for the UK which would be better achieved by unleashing cheap and abundant renewable energy and delivering a nationwide, street-by-street, energy efficiency programme, will not reduce household energy bills, as any oil and gas will be sold on global markets to the highest bidder, fails to respond to the urgency of the climate crisis, to warnings that governments already plan to produce double the amount of fossil fuels&#8239;in 2030&#8239;than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5&#176;C, and to the signal from COP28 in Dubai that the fossil fuel era is over, undermines UK climate targets, with the Climate Change Committee observing that expansion of fossil fuel production is not in line with net zero, proposes weaker tests than those included in the flawed Climate Compatibility Checkpoint, could lead to significant costs to HM Treasury, including the risk of stranded assets, and fails to rule out new oil and gas licences, amend the Petroleum Act 1998 in order to remove the duty to maximise economic recovery of petroleum, or set a new duty for the North Sea Transition Authority to deliver an orderly and just phase-out of oil and gas.</from_cdata></MotionText>

<MotionText><from_cdata>That this House, while affirming the need for urgent action to tackle the UK&#8217;s energy insecurity, the cost of living crisis, and the climate crisis, and for a managed, fair and prosperous transition for workers and communities, declines to give a Second Reading to the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill because mandating annual oil and gas licensing rounds will not reduce energy costs for households and businesses as the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero has stated, will not enhance energy security, offers no plan for the future of the UK&#8217;s offshore energy communities, will ensure the UK remains at the mercy of petrostates and dictators who control fossil fuel markets, is entirely incompatible with the UK&#8217;s international climate change commitments and is a totally unnecessary piece of legislation which will do nothing to serve the UK&#8217;s national interest.</from_cdata></MotionText>

<MotionSponsor>Wera Hobhouse</MotionSponsor>
<MotionText><from_cdata>That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill because, notwithstanding the need to ensure a secure supply of energy, it confers a duty to do what can already be done at least annually and as often as the Government wants, it fails to take vital steps to grow the UK renewable energy sector and reduce energy bills, and it fails to form a coherent path to net zero.</from_cdata></MotionText>

<MotionText><from_cdata>That this House, while acknowledging the role of the exploitation of fossil fuels in ensuring a just transition, and noting that the independent Committee on Climate Change is clear that in reaching net zero by 2050 oil and gas will still be required, declines to give a Second Reading to the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill because the Bill does not provide an evidence-based assessment of all licences on a case-by-case basis based on an ability to simultaneously deliver cheaper energy bills, energy security, job security, net zero commitments and concurrent investment in renewable energy projects, fails to outline a transition away from fossil fuels as per the agreed resolution at COP28, does not acknowledge the climate emergency and does not seek to address the necessity for a reduction in domestic demand.</from_cdata></MotionText>

<MotionText><from_cdata>That this House, while recognising the continuing need to exploit North Sea oil and gas resources as a necessary and ongoing requirement for a just transition for the workers currently employed in the sector, mindful that the UK Government has licensed the Rosebank field with a recoverable oil and gas value of some &#163;30 billion, and while fully supporting the continuation of North Sea extraction, on the explicit condition that all new oil and gas licences should require a specific field commitment of a net zero carbon footprint, achieved largely through developing the carbon capture network, declines to give a Second Reading to the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill given the failure of the UK Government to align North Sea oil production with the refining of oil at the Grangemouth oil refinery and its failure to commit the necessary investment to increase the profitability of the refinery and to secure the long term future of Grangemouth.</from_cdata></MotionText>
