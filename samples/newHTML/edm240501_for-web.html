										<p>That this House notes the First Special Report of the Holocaust Memorial Bill

											restrictions faced by the Committee considering the hybrid Bill; respects
											the conclusions and recommendations on page 20; agrees with the list of

											believes these need updated attention on deliverability from the
											Infrastructure Commission, from the National Audit Office on likely capital
											costs and recurrent annual costs, from the Chancellor on future funding

										<p>That this House celebrates the legacy of the Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST) in
											providing life-changing opportunities for over 55,000 people who have sailed
											with JST tall ships, which were purpose-built with initial funding from the
											Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II fund, and the aim of integrating able-bodied
											and disabled people through tall ship ocean sailing voyages, in which no-one
											is a passenger and everyone works the ship; notes that the SV Tenacious, the
											largest wooden tall ship built in the UK for 100 years, is the only
											remaining tall ship in service in the world which is equipped for disabled
											and non-disabled crew to sail together on equal terms; recognises the deep
											regret at the announcement that the JST has ceased operations and the ship’s
											owning company put into administration, as a result of financial
											difficulties worsened by inactivity during the pandemic; acknowledges that
											without this ship, which is equipped with measures such as wheelchair
											access, a speaking compass, visual and tactile alarms and signage in
											Braille, many people with differing abilities will not be able to experience
											the freedom of ocean sailing, regardless of physical limitations, which has,
											over the decades, created immeasurable cascading benefits to the lives of
											voyage crew, through the challenging and transformative adventure of tall
											ship sailing; and further commends the Save Tall Ship Tenacious campaign,
											wishing them success in their ongoing efforts to save this unique vessel, a
											shining example of inclusion and equality for people with disabilities and
											long-term health conditions.</p>

											continuing to fall all around them; recognises the challenge facing Gabriel

											calls upon the Government of India to consider granting Punjab a level of

										<p>That this House endorses the recognition from Dame Carol Black and the Home
											Affairs Committee that improved use of diversion schemes, where police deal
											with low-level offending without the involvement of courts, can be an
											important tool in reducing drug-related crime; pays tribute to the
											pioneering work of Police-led Drug Diversion (PDD) schemes such as Durham’s
											Checkpoint programme led by the late Ron Hogg, the West Midlands’ Operation
											Turning Point and the Thames Valley Druglink scheme championed by former
											Chief Inspector Jason Kew; highlights the importance of community resolution
											to preclude the need for arrest and to facilitate access to education,
											treatment and support services; welcomes the work of Professor Alex Stevens
											of the University of Kent and Paul Quinton from the College of Policing in
											providing evaluation of PDD schemes and identification of best practice;
											believes this will establish effective national standards and a template to
											end the patchy postcode-lottery of provision; and calls on the Government to
											commit to consistent national roll-out of high-standard diversion schemes,
											as soon as practicable, to provide a cost-effective alternative to the
											current cycle of criminalisation and reoffending.</p>

										<p>That this House marks the 10th anniversary of the UK Government recognising
											the Cornish as a national minority through the Council of Europe’s Framework
											Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; notes that this
											landmark decision set out numerous obligations including support for
											language and culture, education and the media, the greater visibility of
											national minorities in public life, the protection of historic territories,
											more opportunities on the international stage; further notes that the
											decision should afford the Cornish the same status as the UK’s other
											national minorities; is however concerned that the UK Government has yet to
											fully meets its obligations under the Framework Convention by treating
											Cornwall equally with the other national parts of the UK; and calls on the
											UK Government to deliver meaningful devolution through the creation of a
											legislative Cornish Parliament or a National Assembly of Cornwall, full
											membership of the British-Irish Council and other trans-national bodies,
											fair funding for Cornwall and its public services, a Cornish Language Act,
											and public service broadcasting provision for Cornwall.</p>

											single parents and families with disabled children; notes that 20% of all
											households impacted by the two-child limit are families with at least one
											disabled child, which is just over 87,500 households; further notes that 25%
											of all families impacted by the two-child limit are single-parent

											been made by the Department for Work and Pensions; and calls for the
											two-child limit to be reconsidered.</p>

										<p>That this House expresses support and solidarity to members of the PCS union
											taking industrial action against their employer, Border Force, at Heathrow
											Airport; notes that on 29 April around 250 staff are being forced out of
											their current jobs on passport control as the Home Office have indicated

											fixed teams based roster; believes that the proposed new roster will not

											see many staff come off the roster or leave the service; and therefore calls

										<p>That this House recognises the financial and emotional hardship experienced
											by vulnerable, elderly building society customers and their families through
											being introduced by building societies which they trusted to firms offering
											unregulated wills and trusts; acknowledges that the products sold were
											unsuitable and failed, with investments that did not match members’ attitude
											to risk, with excessive fees, and ultimately causing the loss of large
											portions of customers estates, and thereby the loss of their children’s
											inheritance; highlights the concern victims have that the Financial Conduct

											many FCA Principles for Business being breached, and that the societies
											failed to perform satisfactory due diligence on the firms they introduced
											customers to; and as such believes that the FCA should compel the building
